  Sophie, you deserve a love that is deep, unwavering, and true—a love that
  makes you feel safe when the world is uncertain, that reminds you how
  extraordinary you are, even on the days you might forget. But the truth is,
  loving you isn’t something I have to try to do—it’s something that happens
  naturally, effortlessly, in every moment I spend with you. I don’t just love
  you in the big, obvious ways. I love you in the quiet moments, when you’re not
  looking, when you don’t even realize how breathtaking you are. I love you in
  the in the way I instinctively reach for your hand because that’s where it
  belongs.

Sophie, you are not just a part of my life—you are the thread that ties all the best moments together. Every memory, every laugh, every quiet conversation in the middle of the night, they all mean more because you are in them. Life before you feels like a faded, incomplete version of what it was meant to be, and now that I have you, I can’t imagine a world without you in it.

You have given new meaning to the word happiness. Before you, I thought happiness was just a fleeting feeling—something that came and went, something tied to circumstances or passing moments. But you have shown me that happiness can be constant, that it can be found in the simplest things: in the way you smile at me, in the way you absentmindedly reach for my hand, in the way your presence alone makes everything feel lighter. With you, happiness isn’t just a moment—it’s a way of being.

You have redefined what comfort and safety** **mean to me. It’s not just about having a place to rest; it’s about having *you*. You are my peace in a world that can feel chaotic, the steady presence that grounds me when everything else is uncertain. Your embrace is the safest place I have ever known, and the thought of being wrapped in it, of simply being near you, is enough to make even the hardest days feel bearable.

Your voice is more than just a sound to me—it is a balm that soothes every ache in my heart. There have been moments when I have felt lost, overwhelmed, unsure of where to turn, but the second I hear your voice, everything quiets. You don’t even have to say anything profound; just the softness in the way you speak, the kindness in your tone, the way you say my name—it’s enough to remind me that I am not alone, that I never will be, because I have you.

And when the nights are dark, when the weight of the world feels unbearable, you are my daylight. You are the light that dispels my sorrows, the warmth that chases away the cold. No matter how heavy my heart feels, no matter how lost I might be in my own thoughts, knowing that you are in my life makes it all feel surmountable. You don’t just bring me joy—you bring me *hope*.

Sophie, you are not just my Valentine. You are my heart, my home, my greatest love. If you say yes, it won’t just be a moment I celebrate—it will be the moment I cherish for the rest of my life.
