  Sophie, you deserve a love that is deep, unwavering, and true—a love that
  makes you feel safe when the world is uncertain, that reminds you how
  extraordinary you are, even on the days you might forget. But the truth is,
  loving you isn’t something I have to try to do—it’s something that happens
  naturally, effortlessly, in every moment I spend with you. I don’t just love
  you in the big, obvious ways. I love you in the quiet moments, when you’re not
  looking, when you don’t even realize how breathtaking you are. I love you in
  the in the way I instinctively reach for your hand because that’s where it
  belongs.

Loving you has been the most profound, the most beautiful, and the most fulfilling thing I have ever done. Every single day, I wake up knowing that I get to love you—not just in grand declarations, but in the quiet, unspoken ways that mean even more. In the way my fingers find yours instinctively, as if they were always meant to fit. In the way I watch you when you’re not looking, memorizing the way the light dances in your eyes, the way your smile can quiet every storm in me. In the way my heart aches with the sheer depth of what I feel for you—because words will never fully capture the way I love you.

I love you in the moments between moments, in the softness of your laughter, in the warmth of your embrace. I love you in the way you make the world feel a little less heavy, a little less uncertain. With you, Sophie, I don’t just feel safe—I feel invincible. No matter what challenges come our way, no matter what uncertainties the world holds, I know I can face anything, because I have you. Because *we* have each other.

Being loved by you is the greatest gift I have ever received, but getting to love you in return—that is the greatest privilege of my life. You are my greatest adventure, my quiet place, my deepest certainty. And now, as we stand on the edge of forever, I am not just ready—I am *excited* to step into the unknown with you. To build a life together, to write a story that is ours, to wake up next to you every day for the rest of my life, knowing that my greatest dream has already come true.

Sophie, I promise you this: My love for you will never waver, never dim, never falter. I will love you in every breath, in every heartbeat, in every tomorrow we are blessed to have. I will love you on the brightest days and in the quiet, rainy mornings. I will love you when life is effortless and when it is anything but. I will love you with every part of me, always.

So here I am, standing before you, with my heart in your hands, knowing with every fiber of my being that there is nowhere else it belongs. Let’s face the world together. Let’s build a love that outlasts time. Let’s begin forever, Sophie. Because forever has always been you.
