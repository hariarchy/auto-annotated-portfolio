  Sophie, you’re not just someone special—you are the most important person in
  my life. You make the world feel softer, kinder, and more beautiful just by
  being in it. I could search the whole world and never find someone who makes
  me feel the way you do. You bring warmth where there is cold, joy where there
  is emptiness, and love where there is loneliness. Without you, my days
  wouldn’t shine as brightly, and the quiet moments wouldn’t feel as full. You
  are my home, my safe place, and my greatest gift. If you asked me to name one
  thing I am truly grateful for in this life, the answer would always be you.

Sophie, from the very first day we met—our first date in the park, where I showed up late and probably looked like a complete mess—something inside me shifted. I remember feeling nervous, not just because I was late, but because something about you already felt important. And I was right. From that moment on, my life was never the same.

I don’t think I realized it at the time, but looking back, I can see how that day was the beginning of everything. The way you smiled at me, the way you made me feel like being a few minutes late didn’t matter—like I was exactly where I was supposed to be—stuck with me. And from that day forward, I’ve had this constant, undeniable pull toward you. A need to have you in my life in any way I can.

You make everything feel different. The days are brighter because I know I get to share them with you. The quiet moments feel fuller because I know you’re a part of them, even when we’re not in the same place. You bring warmth where there used to be cold, joy where there used to be routine, and love where there used to be something I didn’t even know was missing. You have become my greatest motivation—the person who makes me want to be better, to do more, to be someone worthy of the love you so effortlessly give.

Every moment with you, no matter how small, is something I carry with me. From that first date in the park to now, I’ve never stopped wanting you in my life. And the truth is, I never will. You are my home, my safe place, my greatest gift. If you asked me to name one thing I am truly grateful for in this life, the answer would always, always be you.
